                      After I went into a cardiac arrest last year, I knew I was
                      given a "mulligan" in this game we call life. After weeks
                      of treatment, I decided I wanted to change my life. When I
                      stumbled upon No carbs diet, I was immediately amazed at

                      stumbled upon No carbs diet, I was immediately amazed at
                      how easy the recipes were to follow. The food was
                      fantastic too.<br />
                      <br />
                      What I think sets No carbs diet apart from all the others
                      is that it's not a diet. It's a total lifestyle change and
                      food education.<br />
                      <br />
                      Now, I feel better than I have in years. I’m happy that I
                      will have a chance to watch my grandchildren grow up and
                      be a part of their lives.

                      The beauty of this No carbs program is that you can make
                      it your own. You can eat whenever you want, snack on
                      delicious treats, and still feel great at the end of the
                      day.<br />
                      <br />
                      That’s how it’s been for me. If I can make it this far,
                      anyone can. Thanks to No carbs program for this platform.

                      <br />
                      Then I decided to FIGHT FOR MY HEALTH. No carbs diet
                      changed everything for me. The plan was easy to follow and
                      I was never hungry. After only 4 months, I have so much
                      more energy. I even started working out again.<br />
                      <br />
                      No carbs program has given me my years back. I only wish I
                      had tried it sooner.

                    <br />
                    (c) the purposes for which we may process your personal
                    data; and<br />
                    <br />

                    understanding of how you use our website and services as

                    legal basis for this processing is our legitimate interest,
                    namely the proper management of our website, apps and
                    business.<br />
                    <br />
                    1.7. We may process any of your personal data identified in
                    this notice where necessary for the establishment, exercise
                    or defence of legal claims, whether in court proceedings or
                    in an administrative or out-of-court procedure. The legal
                    basis for this processing is our legitimate interests,
                    namely the protection and assertion of our legal rights,
                    your legal rights and the legal rights of others.<br />
                    <br />
                    1.8. We may process any of your personal data identified in
                    this notice where necessary for the purposes of obtaining or
                    maintaining insurance coverage, managing risks, or obtaining
                    professional advice. The legal basis for this processing is
                    our legitimate interests, namely the proper protection of
                    our business against risks.<br />
                    <br />
                    1.9. In addition to the specific purposes for which we may
                    process your personal data set out in this Section, we may
                    also process any of your personal data where such processing
                    is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which
                    we are subject, or in order to protect your vital interests
                    or the vital interests of another natural person.<br />
                    <br />
                    1.10. Should the purpose or legal basis of data processing
                    activities indicated in this paragraph change, we will
                    inform you and, if the consent was the legal basis for data
                    processing, will re-obtain your consent. <br />
                    <br />
                    1.11. Sometimes we may aggregate, anonymize or de-identify
                    your personal data in such a way so that it cannot
                    reasonably be used to identify you. Such data is no longer
                    personal. We may use such data without restriction in any
                    way allowed by law, including, but not limited to share such
                    data with our partners or research institutions, share in
                    articles, blog posts and scientific publications, aggregate
                    statistics about certain activities or symptoms from data
                    collected to help identify patterns across users and
                    evaluate or modify our services.<br />
                    <br />
                    1.12. We are following the principle of data minimisation:
                    personal data processed is adequate, relevant and limited to
                    what is necessary in relation to the purposes for which it
                    is processed. <br />
                    <br />
                    1.13. Personal data is stored either on the servers of the
                    Company or of our contractors, who are bound by specific
                    contractual clauses regarding the processing of personal
                    data as well as by the confidentiality obligations. <br />
                    <br />
                    1.14. We are using a number of technical and organisational
                    means to protect your personal data. Organisational security
                    measures include restricting access solely to authorised
                    persons with a legitimate need to access personal data,
                    singing confidentiality agreements, arranging trainings,
                    creating and implementing relevant policies and procedures.
                    Technical measures include appropriate actions to address
                    online security, risk of data loss, alteration of data or
                    unauthorised access, implementing access control and
                    authentication tools, ensuring physical security etc.<br />
                    <br />
                    2. WHEN WE PROVIDE YOUR DATA TO OTHERS?<br />
                    <br />
                    2.1. We may disclose your personal data to any member of our
                    group of companies (including our subsidiaries, our ultimate
                    holding company and all its subsidiaries) insofar as
                    reasonably necessary for the purposes set out in this
                    notice. Such may include internal administration purposes as
                    well as provision/sharing of IT services or data centres in

                    6.6. In some circumstances you have the right to restrict
                    the processing of your personal data. Those circumstances

                    the processing is that the processing is necessary for: the
                    performance of a task carried out in the public interest or
                    the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by us or by

                    particular situation, unless the processing is necessary for

                    INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY DAMAGES, OR
                    THOSE RESULTING FROM LOST PROFITS, LOST DATA OR BUSINESS
                    INTERRUPTION, LOSS OF GOODWILL, LOSS OF USE, OR OTHER LOSSES

                    CLIENT’S USE OF THE SERVICES. IN NO EVENT SHALL THE
                    COMPANY’S AGGREGATE LIABILITY TO THE CLIENT RELATING TO
                    HIS/HER USE OF THE SERVICES EXCEED ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS

                    <br />
                    12.3 A party to the Agreement shall be released from
                    responsibility for non-fulfillment if it proves that this
                    Agreement was not fulfilled due to force majeure. In
                    particular, the Company shall not be liable for any losses
                    caused by force majeure, riot, war, or natural events or due
                    to other occurrences for which the Company is not
                    responsible (e.g., strike, lock-out, traffic hold-ups,
                    administrative acts of domestic or foreign high
                    authorities). The Client must provide written notification
                    of the occurrence of force majeure, which prevents the
                    fulfillment of this Agreement, within 30 calendar days from
                    the date of the occurrence of these circumstances. The
                    Company shall inform the Client about the occurrence of
                    force majeure by e-mail or on the Website or Mobile app if
                    possible.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    12.4 Pagina Atual LTDA is an administrator of the Website or
                    Mobile App and provider of the Services, responsible for
                    managing subscription services and payments for Services,
                    refunds, and chargebacks. THE LIABILITY OF THE COMPANY IS
                    LIMITED TO DIRECT LOSSES, UNLESS OTHERWISE PROVIDED UNDER
                    THE APPLICABLE LAWS.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    12.5 Due to the nature of Services that the Company provides
                    and as the Company cannot control the Client’s adherence to
                    the provided use instructions, the Company provides no
                    warranty as to any results or outcomes coming from using
                    Services.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    12.6 When using Services, the Client may receive links to
                    other websites or mobile apps that are not owned and/or
                    controlled by the Company. These are provided “as is.” The
                    Client acknowledges and agrees that the Company is not
                    responsible for the operation of such links. Furthermore,
                    the Company is not responsible or liable for any content,
                    advertising, products, or other materials that may be
                    accessed through such links and therefore the Client agrees
                    that the Company shall not be responsible or liable,
                    directly or indirectly, for any damage or loss caused or
                    alleged to be caused by or in connection with use or
                    reliance on any such content, services available on or
                    through any such websites or mobile apps.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    13. Refund Policy
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    13.1 All purchases are final. The Company does not offer
                    refunds or credits for unused or partially used services,
                    unless required by applicable law.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    13.2 If a refund is mandated by law, the Client must submit
                    a written request to the Company, including all relevant
                    transaction details. The Company will process the refund
                    within a reasonable time frame, as required by law.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    13.3 Chargebacks initiated by the Client without prior
                    communication with the Company may result in immediate
                    termination of access to the Services and the Company
                    reserves the right to dispute such chargebacks.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    13.4 In case of a technical failure or error in the
                    provision of the Services, the Company will assess and
                    determine the appropriate course of action, which may
                    include a refund or service credit at its sole discretion.
                    <br />
