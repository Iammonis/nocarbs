                      After I went into a cardiac arrest last year, I knew I was
                      given a "mulligan" in this game we call life. After weeks
                      of treatment, I decided I wanted to change my life. When I
                      stumbled upon No carbs diet, I was immediately amazed at

                      stumbled upon No carbs diet, I was immediately amazed at
                      how easy the recipes were to follow. The food was
                      fantastic too.<br />
                      <br />
                      What I think sets No carbs diet apart from all the others
                      is that it's not a diet. It's a total lifestyle change and
                      food education.<br />
                      <br />
                      Now, I feel better than I have in years. I’m happy that I
                      will have a chance to watch my grandchildren grow up and
                      be a part of their lives.

                      The beauty of this No carbs program is that you can make
                      it your own. You can eat whenever you want, snack on
                      delicious treats, and still feel great at the end of the
                      day.<br />
                      <br />
                      That’s how it’s been for me. If I can make it this far,
                      anyone can. Thanks to No carbs program for this platform.

                      <br />
                      Then I decided to FIGHT FOR MY HEALTH. No carbs diet
                      changed everything for me. The plan was easy to follow and
                      I was never hungry. After only 4 months, I have so much
                      more energy. I even started working out again.<br />
                      <br />
                      No carbs program has given me my years back. I only wish I
                      had tried it sooner.

                    <br />
                    1.8. We may process any of your personal data identified in
                    this notice where necessary for the purposes of obtaining or

                    professional advice. The legal basis for this processing is
                    our legitimate interests, namely the proper protection of
                    our business against risks.<br />

                    we are subject, or in order to protect your vital interests
                    or the vital interests of another natural person.<br />

                    <br />
                    1.11. Sometimes we may aggregate, anonymize or de-identify

                    <br />
                    1.12. We are following the principle of data minimisation:

                    what is necessary in relation to the purposes for which it
                    is processed.<br />

                    Services will be done in our sole and absolute discretion
                    and without an ongoing obligation or liability to the

                    entitle the Client to the continued provision or

                    The Company may publish information related to this
                    Agreement or Services on the Website or Mobile app as well.
                    The Client should check his/her e-mail messages as well as
                    information provided on the Website or the Mobile app
                    regularly and frequently. E-mails may contain links to
                    further information and documents.<br />
                    <br />
                    16.2. Where applicable laws require the provision of
                    information on a durable medium, the Company will either
                    send the Client an email with an attachment or send the
                    Client a notification referring to the Services with a
                    download function to retain such information and documents
                    permanently for future reference. It is the Client’s
                    responsibility requested to keep copies of all

                    <br />
                    Client should clearly indicate that a complaint is being
                    submitted and specify the grounds and circumstances
                    concerning the complaint. The Company will send a complaint
                    acknowledgment to the e-mail address from which the
                    complaint has been received. We will consider the complaint
                    and respond to the Client within 14 calendar days of the day
                    of receipt of a relevant complaint. If a dispute is not
                    resolved within 30 calendar days of the day of receipt of a
                    relevant complaint, Client or Company may bring a formal
                    claim.<br />
                    <br />
                    17.3. Arbitration. Except for disputes that qualify for
                    small claims court, all disputes arising out of or related
                    to this Agreement or any aspect of the relationship between
                    Client and Company, whether based in contract, tort,
                    statute, fraud, misrepresentation or any other legal theory,
                    will be resolved through final and binding arbitration
                    before a neutral arbitrator instead of in a court by a judge
                    or jury. Client and Company agrees that Client and Company
                    are each waiving the right to trial by a jury. Such disputes
                    include, without limitation, disputes arising out of or
                    relating to interpretation or application of this
                    arbitration provision, including the enforceability,
                    revocability or validity of the arbitration provision or any
                    portion of the arbitration provision. All such matters shall
                    be decided by an arbitrator and not by a court or judge.<br />
                    <br />
                    17.4. Client agrees that any arbitration under this
                    Agreement will take place on an individual basis; class
                    arbitrations and class actions are not permitted and Client
                    is agreeing to give up the ability to participate in a class
                    action.<br />
                    <br />
                    17.5. Client may opt-out of this agreement to arbitrate by

                    with Client’s first name, last name, and address within
                    thirty (30) days of accepting this agreement to arbitrate,
                    with a statement that Client declines this arbitration
                    agreement.<br />
                    <br />
                    17.6. The arbitration will be administered by the American
                    Arbitration Association under its Consumer Arbitration
                    Rules, as amended by this Agreement. The Consumer
                    Arbitration Rules are available online at
                    https://www.adr.org/consumer. The arbitrator will conduct
                    hearings, if any, by teleconference or videoconference,
                    rather than by personal appearances, unless the arbitrator
                    determines upon request by Client or Company that an
                    in-person hearing is appropriate. Any in-person appearances
                    will be held at a location that is reasonably convenient to
                    both parties with due consideration of their ability to
                    travel and other pertinent circumstances. If the parties are
                    unable to agree on a location, such determination should be
                    made by the AAA or by the arbitrator. The arbitrator’s
                    decision will follow the terms of this Agreement and will be
                    final and binding. The arbitrator will have authority to
                    award temporary, interim or permanent injunctive relief or
                    relief providing for specific performance of this Agreement,
                    but only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted
                    by the individual claim before the arbitrator. The award
                    rendered by the arbitrator may be confirmed and enforced in
                    any court having jurisdiction thereof. Notwithstanding any
                    of the foregoing, nothing in this Agreement will preclude
                    Client from bringing issues to the attention of federal,
                    state or local agencies and, if the law allows, they can
                    seek relief against us for you.<br />
                    <br />
                    18. Miscellaneous<br />
                    <br />
                    18.1. No person other than the Client shall have any rights
                    under this Agreement.<br />
                    <br />
                    18.2. Client may not assign any rights under this Agreement
                    to any third party without the prior consent of the Company.
                    The Company at its sole discretion may assign its rights and
                    obligations under this Agreement in full or in part to any
                    third party.<br />
                    <br />
                    18.3. If any part of this Agreement is found by a court of
                    competent jurisdiction to be invalid, unlawful or
                    unenforceable then such part shall be severed from the
                    remainder of the Agreement, which shall continue to be valid
                    and enforceable to the fullest extent permitted by law.<br />
                    <br />
                    18.4. THE USE OF THE SERVICES IS SOLELY AT CLIENT`S OWN
                    RISK. THE SERVICES ARE PROVIDED ON AN “AS IS” AND “AS
                    AVAILABLE” BASIS. THE COMPANY EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ALL
                    WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND WITH RESPECT TO THE SERVICES, WHETHER

                    FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT OF
                    INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY OR ARISING FROM A COURSE OF DEALING,
                    USAGE OR TRADE PRACTICE. SOME STATES DO NOT ALLOW THE
                    EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO THE ABOVE EXCLUSIONS MAY
                    NOT APPLY TO THE CLIENT. THE COMPANY MAKES NO WARRANTY THAT
                    THE SITE OR SERVICE WILL MEET CLIENT`S REQUIREMENTS, OR WILL
                    BE UNINTERRUPTED, TIMELY, SECURE, CURRENT, ACCURATE,
                    COMPLETE OR ERROR-FREE OR THAT THE RESULTS THAT MAY BE
                    OBTAINED BY USE OF THE SITE OR SERVICE WILL BE ACCURATE OR
                    RELIABLE. CLIENT UNDERSTAND AND ACKNOWLEDGE THAT HIS/HER
                    SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY WITH RESPECT TO ANY DEFECT IN OR
                    DISSATISFACTION WITH THE SITE OR SERVICE IS TO CEASE TO USE
                    THE SERVICES. CLIENT MAY HAVE OTHER RIGHTS, WHICH MAY VARY
                    FROM STATE TO STATE.<br />
                    <br />
                    18.5. BY USING OR ACCESING THE SERVICES, CLIENT HEREBY
                    ACKNOWLEDGES THAT HE/SHE HAS READ THIS AGREEMENT, UNDERSTOOD
                    IT, AND AGREES TO BE BOUND BY ITS TERMS AND CONDITIONS.
