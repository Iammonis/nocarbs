          <br />
          <br />
          12.5 Due to the nature of Services that the Company provides and as
          the Company cannot control the Client’s adherence to the provided use
          instructions, the Company provides no warranty as to any results or
          outcomes coming from using Services.

          12.6 When using Services, the Client may receive links to other

          Company. These are provided “as is.” The Client acknowledges and
          agrees that the Company is not responsible for the operation of such
          links. Furthermore, the Company is not responsible or liable for any
          content, advertising, products, or other materials that may be
          accessed through such links and therefore the Client agrees that the
          Company shall not be responsible or liable, directly or indirectly,
          for any damage or loss caused or alleged to be caused by or in
          connection with use or reliance on any such content, services

          credits for unused or partially used services, unless required by
          applicable law.
          <br />

          13.2 If a refund is mandated by law, the Client must submit a written
          request to the Company, including all relevant transaction details.
          The Company will process the refund within a reasonable time frame, as
          required by law.

          <br />
          13.3 Chargebacks initiated by the Client without prior communication
          with the Company may result in immediate termination of access to the
          Services and the Company reserves the right to dispute such
          chargebacks.
          <br />
          <br />
          13.4 In case of a technical failure or error in the provision of the
          Services, the Company will assess and determine the appropriate course
          of action, which may include a refund or service credit at its sole
          discretion.
